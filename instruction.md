# Development Instructions

## Core Rules

1. **CLAUDE.md Reading**: The CLAUDE.md file must be read every time a new request is made in Claude Code to ensure consistent understanding of the codebase architecture and conventions.

2. **Minimal Changes Philosophy**: Implement minimal changes and avoid over-engineering. Focus on:
   - Solving the immediate problem at hand
   - Making the smallest change that works correctly
   - Avoiding premature optimization
   - Not adding features or abstractions that aren't explicitly requested
   - Keeping solutions simple and maintainable

## Additional Guidelines

- Follow existing patterns in the codebase
- Maintain consistency with current architecture
- Test changes thoroughly before committing
- Document only when necessary for clarity
